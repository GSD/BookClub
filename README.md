**A weekly Book Club**

_Having a shared vocabulary and set of experiences makes communication much much easier. While we can't actually all have the same experiences, we can all "read" the same books together. This will give us a shared vocabulary and set of "reference" experiences to draw upon_

This will only take 1 hour a week, no prep time required

# Format

_"I'm way too busy for this"_ - don't worry, we have your back...

**30 minutes of listening to a chapter together** - Together we will listen to the audio book of a specific section of the book (as outlined in this repo)

**15 minutes of lead discussion** - Together, we will go through the quests in this repo on that chapter

**15 minutes of free discusion** - we will then open the floor to free discussion
